 ### User Experience (UX)

<a name="Pro"></a>
 * ### Project Goals

   The project is a drop flyer that allows the festival goer to select tickets for the displayed event. Also there are external links that show other festivals, and the external limks disply videos of festivals and other media outlets.

### Developer Business and Goals.


<img width="750" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-15 073313" src="https://github.com/Sniffy2019/Deep-State-weekender/assets/122370573/73a4c3b0-925f-42e9-a9ed-b236d0dc5437">


The "index.page", is a flyer showing what dates the festival is at the 02 arena in London.
The client can visit various social media outlets to see what has happened before and which is current now, the site allows the festival goer to see what is happening around the country and see other revellers having a good time.
The aim is to develop flyers that interact with the client so they can select this event and also book mark other potential events.
Its a blend of a drop flyer with a "ticketmaster" addition added to it.

### User Stories





The user if, interested can use the ticketing purchase page to buy said tickets , they can then return home and visit other pages to follow other festivals and events.
I would quite like to try before I buy so its an accumulation of event selling as well as ticket purchasing.
There is also a map to show the address of the event.
There are interactive social pages showing different festivals and interaction on the media sites.

<a name="Des"></a>
## Design

The design is based on a nineties or retro-style drop flyer.
The two images are of freestock festival/gig events and the contrast is to depict the outdoor and indoor selection of a 3 day festival.
The footer is taken from the code institute CV design and modified to allow the user to select either payment or follow other festival goers.
There is also a map which pinpoints onto the O2 Arena. The user can take down the address, or zoom in or out to see where the event is taking place.

<a name="Font"></a>
### font styles used

Permanent Marker, sans-serif;
Helvetica Neue for the Stripe page.
Usage from Google font-awesome.


<a name="Colour"></a>
### Colours and background images.

The colours for the main page are a 'vibrant catch the user’s eye’ style, with the image of two photos depicting revellers having a good time. 
The writing is done using a marker pen to give a real festival feel to it.
Underneath the sections are on a straightforward background with white writing; the 4 sections then allow you to purchase tickets, see other events, look for the site via google maps and follow the social elements of the web site.
The nav bar at the bottom is dark slate gray just to allow white writing and the buttons to have some contrast.
The line up page is the flyer just with the three dates on and a selection of Dj's/bands. These of course are made up and the site just depicts what the reveller would hypothetically see if they chose the full three day festival, or a day of their choosing.
The backgound colour is white as it allows the payment page and map clear definition on their respective pages.

<a name="Feat"></a>
### Features

The whole theme of the site has a happy, calm, and partying tone of images  to make the user feel comfortable navigating through the pages.

Purchase tickets is a button function that takes you to a ticket purchasing page with a countdown timer and home return page. The download and 'Social elements' are explained below.
Purchase tickets is a mock up of the "stripe" online pay system. Simple colours used to add your details in and bright warning alerts if payment wasn't successful. 
The map page allow to see where the event is happening and you get the excat location.
The social elements on the footer of the main page, have been made to look like straightforward icons of the different social media with you tube showing a video of a different festival.
All these are explained in the manual testing element of this README.md.

### Manual Testing

As we are using various platforms to run the code. I found using ../index.html the easiest way to link pages back home.
Otherwise, it would not load and try and link to assets pages.


GitHub (https://github.com/Sniffy2019/Deep-State-weekender
)
Using  Code anywhere the command line was easier to establish commits. Once using the port 8000 sometimes the changes would lag or not update at all.

The front page or "index.html" page. Has two functioning buttons one for purchasing tickets and the other for finding the 02 arena.

The payment page is mock up of a Stripe payment system. If you put an actual recognised credit card or debit card it will say payment successful. As I didn't want to actually go any deeper the page states that as a matter of default as I dont want anyone's personal details entered.
If the card isn't recognised then the page states this.
You can actually add details in but it will not save them as  a standard interactive payment page would.
There is also a countdown timer which infers to the time left to purchase tickets.
The page has a home page with the drop down menu but that is more for effect to highlight the home page.
The features for the purpose of this site works well and respond as expected.

The second button is "find us here" and shows a map of the 02 site where you can click on the site to get the exact address.
I've down loaded an Api from google apps and its restricted to a certain amount of use so for the purpose of display and tutors marking it will display. You may need to hit F5 to refresh or go into developer tools and come out again for the page to refresh.
It does work but it can be hit and miss depending on the users cache or settings on the Chrome develope site.

The download pages offer two sites. 1) A site to look out for other festivals and gigs for the season. 2) the playlist, which I thought about using Javascript to construct but, upon looking at professional website the construct is alone a few weeks worth of work plus so much copywrite protected sources it would have never been feasibile in such a short space of time unless you have these libraries to hand.
So its the front page with a made up lineup.






<a name="Bugs"></a>
### Glitches/Bugs

The pages and links have been tested, and the buttons react well.

Stripe has been capped at not going beyond the initial page as I would not want to expose real credit card data, to show the payment page works.
You can add your card details if you wish as it will state if the card is valid, if wrongly entered or keep the payment successful note at the bottom if an actual credit card has been entered correctly.There is a default state of saying the payment is succesful as that element has been used as a default in Javascript to show the page rather than be fully interactive.

The image depicts the purchasing page with a home return button, if a non-recognised card number is placed as shown above.


The map somtimes does not load on first selection of the button onto the find us here page.
I've included a screen shot of the map and have used a google API which is restricted but only for IP addresses.
The issue is the developer tool in Chrome. If you go into inspect and the developer tools you can clear the issue and the map shows on the page.

When on the map page google developers tools states this error.

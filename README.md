 ### User Experience (UX)

 * ### Project Goals

   The project is a drop flyer that allows the festival goer to select tickets for the displayed event. Also there are external links that show other festivals, and the external limks disply videos of festivals and other media outlets.



* The ease of interaction between pages to see what the benefits are and how to set up a subscription.

* The reviews on the front page let the user know it’s a reputable site for selling/subscribing books.

* There is a slight advertising pitch on the Read-more.html page to recommend friends and other book lovers to encourage word of mouth of the website.

* The survey page (see-here-for-details.html) encourages feedback, lets the site understand the user’s personal preference, and encourages the information by entering a prize draw.


### Developer Business and Goals.


<img width="750" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-15 073313" src="https://github.com/Sniffy2019/Deep-State-weekender/assets/122370573/73a4c3b0-925f-42e9-a9ed-b236d0dc5437">


The "index.page" ,is a flyer showing what dates the festival is at the 02 arena in London.
The client can visit various social media outlets to see what has happened before and which is current now, the site allows the festival goer to see what is happening around the country and see other revellers having a good time.
The aim is to develop flyers that interact with the client so they can select this event and also book mark other potential events.
Its a blend of a drop flyer with a "ticketmaster" addition added to it.


### User Stories

<img width="750"  height="650" alt="purchasing tickets" src="https://github.com/Sniffy2019/Deep-State-weekender/assets/122370573/df998a0b-fbfa-4b28-9cd6-063b4e40c98a">


The image depicts the purchasing page with a home return button, if a non-recognised card number is placed as shown above.
The user if interested can use the ticketing purchase page to buy said tickets, they can then return home and visit other pages to follow other festivals and events.
I would quite like to try before I buy so its an accumulation of event selling as well as ticket purchasing.

## Design

The design is based on a nineties or retro style drop flyer.
The two images are of freestock festival/gig events and the contrast is to depict the outdoor and indoor selection of a 3 day festival.
The footer is taken from the code institute CV design and modified to allow the user to select either payment or floow other festival goers.

### font styles used

Permanent Marker, sans-serif;
Usage from Google font-awesome.



### Colours and background images.

The colours for the main page are a 'vibrant catch the user’s eye’ style, with the image of books made into the current year.
The reviews are left on white background for simplicity, also this makes the images stand out more.
Underneath the background image of a young girl reading with the 3 columns and read more buttons.

The whole theme of the site has a warm, calm, and relaxing tone of images and colours to make the user feel comfortable navigating through the pages.

About.html has an old library background image with the 'Let’s sign you up form'. The Nav bar and 'follow us' is explained below.
Read more and the survey shares the same background image of an open book set onto a backdrop of a sunset.
The columns are set with an opacity % to let the text be seen but not camouflaged with the background image.
All the images in the assets folder were sourced via https://unsplash.com/s/photos/books and converted into jpegs or png's via Flickr.

The nav bar (especially index.html) and the social elements on the footer of (about.html) pages, have been made to look like a book or wooden rails you might see in an old book store or library.



### Links to additional pages are in the assets folder.

[A link to GitHub] (https://github.com/Sniffy2019/Deep-State-weekender)

Using  code anywhere and using the terminal $ python3 -m http.server
then using port 8000 will show the web page.



## Design of web page, built from the  Code Institute learning course,  using the following:-

* The rest of the pages were an enlargement of a section of the front page or the design above, with a background image plus a sign-up form or survey box added.

### Testing and ensuring pages work

As we are using various platforms to run the code. I found using ../index.html the easiest way to link pages back home.
Otherwise, it would not load and try and link to assets pages.

For mobile use the drop-down links were used on each page as the menu didn't blend in with the chosen background, the only page with one link is the form.html page, as that directs you back home only for ease of use.

### Glitches/Bugs

The pages and links have been tested, and the buttons react well.


### Version control

GitHub (https://github.com/Sniffy2019/Love-to-Read)
Using Gitpod or code anywhere the command line was easier to establish commits. Once using the port 8000 sometimes the changes would lag or not update at all.

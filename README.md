 ### User Experience (UX)

<a name="Pro"></a>
 * ### Project Goals

   The project is a drop flyer that allows the festival goer to select tickets for the displayed event. Also there are external links that show other festivals, and the external limks disply videos of festivals and other media outlets.



* The ease of interaction between pages to see what the benefits are and how to set up a subscription.

* The reviews on the front page let the user know it’s a reputable site for selling/subscribing books.

* There is a slight advertising pitch on the Read-more.html page to recommend friends and other book lovers to encourage word of mouth of the website.

* The survey page (see-here-for-details.html) encourages feedback, lets the site understand the user’s personal preference, and encourages the information by entering a prize draw.

### Developer Business and Goals.

The "index.page" ,is a flyer showing what dates the festival is at the 02 arena in London.
The client can visit various social media outlets to see what has happened before and which is current now, the site allows the festival goer to see what is happening around the country and see other revellers having a good time.
The aim is to develop flyers that interact with the client so they can select this event and also book mark other potential events.
Its a blend of a drop flyer with a "ticketmaster" addition added to it.

### User Stories

<img width="750"  height="650" alt="purchasing tickets" src="https://github.com/Sniffy2019/Deep-State-weekender/assets/122370573/df998a0b-fbfa-4b28-9cd6-063b4e40c98a">


The image depicts the purchasing page with a home return button, if a non-recognised card number is placed as shown above.
The user if interested can use the ticketing purchase page to buy said tickets, they can then return home and visit other pages to follow other festivals and events.
I would quite like to try before I buy so its an accumulation of event selling as well as ticket purchasing.

## Design

The design is based on a nineties or retro-style drop flyer.
The two images are of freestock festival/gig events and the contrast is to depict the outdoor and indoor selection of a 3 day festival.
The footer is taken from the code institute CV design and modified to allow the user to select either payment or floow other festival goers.

### font styles used

### Colours and background images.

The colours for the main page are a 'vibrant catch the user’s eye’ style, with the image of two photos depicting revellers having a good time. 
The writing is done using a marker pen to give a real festival feel to it.
Underneath the sections are on a straighforward background with white writing; the 3 sections then allow you to purchase tickets, see other events and follow the social elements of the web sute.

The whole theme of the site has a happy, calm, and partying tone of images  to make the user feel comfortable navigating through the pages.

Purchase tickets is a button function that takes you to a ticket purchasing page with a countdown timer and home return page. The download and 'Social elements' are explained below.
Purchase tickets is a mock up of the "stripe" online pay system. Simple colours used to add your details in and bright warning alerts if payment wasn't successful. 

The social elements on the footer of the main page, have been made to look like straightforward icons of the different social media with you tube showing a video of a different festival.

### Testing

* Tests have been run on Code anywhere
Using Html, CSS and Javascript.

* https://github.com/Sniffy2019/Deep-State-weekender

* Glitch was used to format the code in Html and CSS.
* Checked via glitch for presentation.

* W3C was used to eliminate any glaring errors and conflicts on the web pages.
* Main index.html, assets/html(s) and style.css checked via W3C

* Jest wea used to test index.js

All other pages passed from W3C HTML checker.

* Lighthouse was used to test mobile response time.
* Lighthouse used to check mobile speed and responses of the links.






main source code taken and modified from the Code Institute.

### Testing and ensuring pages work

As we are using various platforms to run the code. I found using ../index.html the easiest way to link pages back home.
Otherwise, it would not load and try and link to assets pages.

For mobile use the drop-down links were used on each page as the menu didn't blend in with the chosen background, the only page with one link is the form.html page, as that directs you back home only for ease of use.

### Glitches/Bugs

The pages and links have been tested, and the buttons react well.


### Version control

GitHub (https://github.com/Sniffy2019/Love-to-Read)
Using Gitpod or code anywhere the command line was easier to establish commits. Once using the port 8000 sometimes the changes would lag or not update at all.
